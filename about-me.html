      <p class="fade-in">Hello all and thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I was born in Racine WI
        and have spent most of my life in the midwest. School briefly in St Paul MN and I spent a year in Memphis TN while working in the car business. 
        I started with Amazon in 2020 and after a year or so was offered a position at Central Flow in Tempe AZ. This is where I discovered 
        my interest in programming and web design. Thanks to Amazon I was able to take advantage of their Career Choice Program and start 
        learning more about the Tech Industry through Correlation One. I hope to align my career to it in the coming years.
        <br><br>

        In my free time I am a competitive billiard
        player and instructor. I have two cats Jasper and Jasmin and we enjoy lazy days on the couch.
        I have finally gotten the chance to do some hiking out here though and would definitely recommend it if you are ever out this way. 
        The scenery is absolutely amazing at sunrise/sunset!
